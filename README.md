That was written when I was 14 years, 8 years ago, time flies.

Well, this is the first public release of this "mini-game", I started to make it in 2013, but I didn't know about git in that time.

The game no longer works because it don't use any build system like Gradle or Maven.

This was developed following the tutorial of [Oskar Veerhoek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G_xtkvyleM)

I have a plan to update it to LWJGL3 and use Gradle in the near future.
